✅ Prompt for Copilot: Code Review of Python Desktop Application

“I want you to perform a comprehensive code review of my Python application. The project includes both a CLI interface and a NiceGUI-based desktop interface, and it uses a local SQLite database. Please analyze the code following Python best practices, clean architecture principles, and modern standards for maintainability, readability, and performance.

For each file or module I provide, I want you to:

    Identify issues, code smells, and anti-patterns

    Evaluate structure, naming, modularity, and separation of concerns

    Check for security risks, especially around SQLite usage and input handling

    Review CLI and NiceGUI interface design patterns

    Assess database interactions for correctness and efficiency

    Highlight opportunities for refactoring or simplification

    Recommend improvements with clear explanations

    Provide actionable steps and example code snippets when appropriate

At the end, summarize the overall health of the codebase and propose a prioritized action plan for improvements. Let me know when you're ready for the first file.”
